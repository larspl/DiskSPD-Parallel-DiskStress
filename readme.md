### DiskSPD Storage testing in parallel for SQL Server real live Simulations 


In the core it uses DiskSpd.exe a tool from Microsoft for storage testing. 
The DiskSPD basics\functionality remains same. 
The script is more of customization and automation using the common inputs and outputs. Makes using otherwise messy DiskPSD a breeze.
